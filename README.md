## Context

With the emergence of Covid-19 all around the World, many people, companies and organizations started adopting remote procedures like video-conferences to continue doing the commons tasks they used to do "in person". Therefore, the search and use of these type of systems that allow video and voice calls has increased a lot. 
However, most of these currents systems do not provide an interactive  environment and visualization, that mimics real life behaviours.
